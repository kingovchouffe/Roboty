2024-01-14 14:23:51 16496  [WARNING] Warning: One or more nets are completely unrouted.  Do you want to connect them using "virtual", Manhattan-style routing?  (Does not apply to power-supply nets.)  Note: This process will begin by determining the detailed routing status of every net on the board, which can be very time-consuming (especially if some power-supply nets are mistakenly identified as signal nets).  If you prefer to skip this process now, you can run it later using Edit > Connect Nets with Manhattan Routing. - The "Yes" button was selected

2024-01-31 22:41:41 3396     [INFO] This design's .HYP file was created by a PCB translator that did not record whether the physical information is sufficiently detailed for power-integrity analysis (especially metal areas and via clearances).  Most likely, the translator was an older version not upgraded for PI usage.  PI simulation may therefore produce less-accurate results.
